# aj-comp-challenge-1

The static comp challenge is a series of three challenges to keep you working that HTML/CSS muscle. 💪 You will be asked to recreate a static comp, with each growing in complexity. For each challenge, you’ll be given a static comp and asked to recreate it. Don’t worry, we’ll give you a bit of creative license, however the objective is to build something that respects the integrity of the original design.
